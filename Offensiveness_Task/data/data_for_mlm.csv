24302,@RealJamesWoods Does that mean @Twitter @facebook and @youtube will now start shadow-banning or outright removal of @ICEgov @DHSgov @FBI and other US Government tweets and posts about #IllegalAliens ???
24303,"@RealJamesWoods It's unfair to immigrants who go through legal channels to reside,work or go to school, here in the U.S., that #IllegalAliens are allowed to stay without documentation. Let them go home and apply for a visa like all the LEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAVE. WHAT MAKES ILLEGALS EXEMPT?"
24304,@RealJamesWoods @Chucky1688 If uncle Sam can use #IllegalAliens then why does twatter have a problem if I use #IllegalAliens asking for a friend
24305,@RealJamesWoods So Twitter opposes the term #IllegalAliens but allows this from verified accounts. Makes sense.
